P Design Specs From Andrew
P 
P Required Design Components
P --Transport mechanism-- to accurately advance the frames
P         --i.e. geneva mechanism, or stepper motor with position feedback sensors..
P         --film movement is to be synchronized with the capture function of a camera, taking images when a new frame is at rest
P         --speed of advancing frame rate will be limited by the camera which is expected to only be capable of 1-3 fps
P         --specifying and fabrication of necessary parts
P --Film gate-- to align and flatten the
